# Chatini
A chat I'm doing to practice MEAN Stack and Typescript.


### Browser chat:

* Create a web service that will:
* Allow a browser to connect as a chat client
* Allow users to identify themselves uniquely (accounts)
* Allow users to hold a list of other users that mutually wish to keep track of each other. 
* Allow users to communicate in real-time through the browser
  * Must be able to send text messages
  * Must be able to send scribbles (messages in image form)
* Allow users to communicate in groups or one-on-one. 
* Allow users to join a conversation in progress
  * Old messages do not need to be sent.
* Implement a feature that will allow the server to detect the userâ€™s locale and serve the UI in that locale. 
  * Allow the user to select a prefered locale, and have the server serve the UI in that locale for all future requests.
